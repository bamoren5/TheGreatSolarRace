			<span style = "color:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-size: 20px;"> Pride and honor.</span> These are the merits one earns upon competing in The Great Solar Race, but only one of the 8 planetary tribes goes on to become much more. Throughout the Solar System they are known as Immortals. Some refer to them as gods, champions of the stars. And alongside the grand title, control of the governing bodies of each planet through the massive energy gained from the Pyro Star. Despite the mutual respect each tribe has for one another, this doesn’t leave out basic emotions of jealousy and desire, for those who are caught to be meddling in the dark will be cast out, shun from the race and society, or worse.

			Once considered a planet among its peers, Pluto was banned and stripped of a large majority of its resources after the home tribe was found to be altering their Philter of Repair, a potion provided to all participants that allows them to survive most conditions of each planet. Now a barren wasteland shrouded in ice and darkness, Pluto is home to thieves, murderers, and all outcasts.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			During this time of preparation, a group of new era high-born dwarves from Mercury felt that they had a calling for greatness, and the need to rule all no matter the cost. They questioned why they were forced to sit back in their wealth, while the current rulers from Jupiter lay on a throne that governs all. In their eyes, a time for peace was also a call for war until they were given what they were due. It was no secret that Pluto had the resources to get them where they needed to be, even if it meant drowning their gold into blood. Upon striking a deal with a mysterious Plutonian merchant, Rian, the leading representative for the high-born dwarves, provided all their participating tribe members the very same philter used by Pluto many centuries ago. He was promised a certain victory by the merchant, and with slight modifications, they planned on using this grand elixir to enhance their senses, taking one step closer to their ultimate goal.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			48 hours after drop off, the 39th Solar Race was set to commence. Rian and the dwarves following his lead (Tyra, Iona, Pyrs, and Ewan) remained silent throughout the challenges, as they understood the possible consequences that lay before them. One by one, the tribes were transported across the Solar System, competing in tests of strength, endurance, and intelligence. When possible, the dwarves would reconvene, reminding one another to reserve themselves as a way to conceal their temporary abilities. And while all seemed to be going according to plan, Rian and his followers failed to consider the side effects behind the altered philter.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			With the next challenge set on Uranus, tribes began preparing their best warriors for combat. Assigned to battle in the fifth quadrant, the high-born dwarves began to discuss who would challenge the Frost Giants from Jupiter. It was known by all participants that death could occur, and in this particular matter, would occur. This did not stop Rian from welcoming the opportunity to watch his tribe fight and potentially kill those who ruled over him for the last two centuries, that is, until the matter of civil war arised. Rian turned to the sight of fists clenching and screams grinding back and forth. Iona and Pyrs were seconds away from gutting one another. The question being why. The remaining elixir in Rian’s pocket transitioned into a dark gray and began to bubble. In that moment the truth struck. Side effects of built up rage and strength slowly tore the dwarves from the inside. In the blink of an eye, Iona cut through Pyrs as if he were made of cotton, and soon, all-out war broke loose. Rian watched helplessly as his comrades slaughtered themselves without hesitation. Flashbacks raced through his mind from the day he met the merchant, showing images of a foolish boy making a deal with death himself. In a fate worse than hell, Rian was forever trapped to witness the sight of his people’s bloodshed over and over again. Though he was the only one to survive, he was as gone as his comrades, an empty shell that could no longer think or speak for itself. As a sign of respect and mourning, the Pyro Star was gifted to the surviving dwarves back on Mercury, with all unaware of the actions Rian had taken to win.

			The merchant promised his people victory, and he did not lie.
